All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: The wrap method is really elegant.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:Like, I forget to reuse the method in the class, I think next time I will try to think about how to use that.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:Yeah, like the last question.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:More about the mod use and the nextFirst and the nextLast pointer.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:Yeah, more elegant.
